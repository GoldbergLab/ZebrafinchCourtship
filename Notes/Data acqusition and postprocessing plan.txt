Record together:
 - 6 male mics
 - 6 female mics
 - 6 male perches
 - 6 female perches
 - 1 video sync channel

Post-processing
1. Separate and rename channels into separate folders, one per male box
Each of the 6 resulting box folder will have
 - 1 male mic
 - 1 female mic
 - 1 male perch
 - 1 female perch
 - 1 video sync channel

 - some kind of video tracking output?

2. Run macro within electro-gui to take video tracking Incorporate video tracking output and turn it into a boolean
 - 1 boolean for each female, true if in box, false otherwise

3. Run macro within electro-gui to take female perch channels and convert them to both markers and a boolean
 - Debounce perch signal to eliminate spurious hops
 - Make a marker out of each perch "session"
 - Add a boolean to every file that has at least one legit perch "session"

4. Run automatic syllable identification - try to improve this with Caleb
